## 3. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & BUSINESS CASE

*Explain why this software project must exist. What observable real-world problem or operational friction does it eliminate? (Provide 1–2 structured paragraphs).*

- **Operational Background:** *[Describe the current state, user environment, and existing workflow prior to this system.]*
- **Core Problem Statement:** *[Specify the key pain points, manual overhead, booking conflicts, lack of visibility, or communication bottlenecks causing measurable inefficiency.]*
- **Proposed Software Solution:** *[Detail what the software application will deliver to directly resolve the core problem, including key system capabilities and expected user benefits.]*

---

## 4. SMART PROJECT OBJECTIVES

*Define 3 to 5 Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) objectives. Avoid vague declarations such as "Build good software".*

1. **Objective 1 (Core Functional Capability):**  
   *[e.g., Implement and deploy the real-time reservation engine with automated conflict prevention and API response times under 500ms before Week 8.]*
2. **Objective 2 (Operational & User Validation):**  
   *[e.g., Onboard at least 30 active university student test users and successfully process a minimum of 50 authentic bookings during the Week 12 pilot trial.]*
3. **Objective 3 (Engineering Rigor & Quality Gate):**  
   *[e.g., Maintain 100% compliance with Conventional Commits, enforce automated GitHub Actions CI builds on all Pull Requests, and ensure zero unreviewed PRs merged into `main`.]*
4. **Objective 4 (Production Deployment & Client Handover):**  
   *[e.g., Deliver a fully operational cloud-hosted production deployment (Vercel/Cloudflare Pages and managed database) and secure formal client acceptance sign-off by Week 13.]*

## 7. PROJECT MANAGEMENT STACK & GITHUB ECOSYSTEM

*The project strictly utilizes the **unified GitHub platform** as its complete engineering and project management suite. External tracking tools (e.g., Jira, Trello, Asana, ClickUp) are not permitted.*

| Project Management Domain | GitHub Tool / Feature | Governance Standard |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Source Code Repository** | **GitHub Repository** | Standard branch protection on `main`; commit history must follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`). |
| **Project Tracking & Board** | **GitHub Projects (Board & Table)** | Kanban columns: `Backlog`, `Ready`, `In Progress`, `In Review`, `Done`. Every active task must be tracked on this board. |
| **Task & Work Package Management** | **GitHub Issues** | One issue per WBS deliverable or feature. Each issue must state clear acceptance criteria, assignee, and milestone. |
| **Code Review & Quality Control** | **GitHub Pull Requests (PRs)** | All changes merged via PR; mandatory self-testing notes and at least 1 peer approval before merge. Direct push to `main` is forbidden. |
| **Milestone Tracking** | **GitHub Milestones** | Milestones configured to match course checkpoints (e.g., `M1: Charter`, `M2: WBS`, `M5: Midterm Demo`, `M8: Release`). |
| **Continuous Integration & Delivery** | **GitHub Actions** | Automated workflows running on every PR to verify linting, code formatting, unit tests, and build stability. |

## 9. DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY & CADENCE

### 9.1. Chosen Development Methodology
*Select the software engineering process model that governs your delivery lifecycle:*
- [ ] **Iterative & Incremental Development** (Timeboxed 2–3 week delivery cycles with progressive feature refinement)
- [ ] **Agile Flow / Kanban** (Continuous delivery prioritized by pull limits and work-in-progress constraints)
- [ ] **Hybrid (Milestone-Gated Iterative)** (Predictable architectural and governance milestones combined with flexible feature iterations)
- [ ] **Structured Sequential / Waterfall** (Phase-gated progression suited for strictly fixed, pre-defined technical specifications)

### 9.2. Methodology Justification
*Provide a concise rationale explaining why this methodology is optimal for your project:*
- **Requirement Volatility & Discovery:** *[e.g., End-user booking rules may evolve following initial user testing; iterative cycles enable fast feedback without breaking system foundations.]*
- **Stakeholder Availability:** *[e.g., The client stakeholder is available for progress reviews every two weeks on Friday afternoons.]*
- **Technical Risk Management:** *[e.g., The project involves new cloud and database technologies, necessitating early technical spikes and rapid prototyping.]*

## 11. CONSTRAINTS, ASSUMPTIONS & INITIAL RISKS

### 11.1. Project Constraints (Triple Constraint)
- **Schedule:** Absolute completion and deployment deadline by Week 14; final defense in Week 15.
- **Budget & Infrastructure:** \$0 total budget. Must utilize free-tier cloud platforms (e.g., Cloudflare Pages, Supabase, Vercel, Render, GitHub Free).
- **Technology Stack:** *[Specify mandatory technologies: e.g., Next.js / Flutter / FastAPI / PostgreSQL / Supabase]*

### 11.2. Key Assumptions
- The project sponsor / client stakeholder will review deliverables within 3 business days of milestone submission.
- Selected free-tier cloud services and third-party APIs will maintain availability throughout the academic term.
- All team members have continuous access to working development machines and reliable Internet connectivity.

### 11.3. Top 3 Initial Project Risks

| Initial Risk | Probability | Impact | Proactive Response & Mitigation Plan |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **1. Unbalanced workload or unexpected skill gaps** | Medium | High | Decompose work packages into small issues ($\le 2$ days effort); implement pair programming during Week 3 setup. |
| **2. Scope creep from uncontrolled feature additions** | High | High | Enforce Section 5.2 Out-of-Scope boundaries; require formal written Change Requests before accepting any scope adjustments. |
| **3. Client delay in validating milestone acceptance** | Medium | Medium | Schedule recurring review meetings 2 weeks in advance; maintain automated staging environments for immediate inspection. |

## 12. SUCCESS CRITERIA & DEFINITION OF DONE (DoD)

### 12.1. Project Success Criteria
1. **Functional Completeness:** 100% of committed In-Scope features are operational in production with zero critical defects.
2. **Authentic Validation:** Formal written acceptance sign-off obtained from the project sponsor/client by Week 13.
3. **Engineering Integrity:** Complete Evidence Package submitted with authentic GitHub commit logs, active board history, automated CI builds, and test coverage evidence.

### 12.2. Engineering Definition of Done (DoD) for Every Work Item

- [ ] Source code is implemented, properly formatted, and tested locally.
- [ ] A GitHub Pull Request is opened with a clear description referencing the issue (e.g., `Resolves #24`).
- [ ] At least one designated team member has reviewed and formally approved the Pull Request.
- [ ] Automated GitHub Actions CI workflow (linting, build test) passes with green status.
- [ ] Security scan verified: no API keys, tokens, or environment credentials committed to Git.
- [ ] Code is merged into the integration branch (`main` or `staging`) and deployed to the preview environment.
